# Dual Caching (S3 + GitHub Actions Cache)

**Dual Caching** allows your GitHub Actions workflows to save and restore cache bundles across **both** remote S3-compatible storage and GitHub's native Actions Cache service simultaneously.

---

## Why Dual Caching?

In modern CI/CD setups, organizations often run a hybrid infrastructure:

- Standard linting, light tests, and PR checks run on **GitHub-hosted runners** (`ubuntu-latest`).
- Heavy compilation, Docker builds, GPU workloads, and integration tests run on **self-hosted runners** (Kubernetes, AWS EC2, or on-premise bare-metal).

This creates a common challenge:

1. **Runner Isolation**: Self-hosted or remote runners may have high latency, bandwidth limits, or restricted access to GitHub's internal cache service, but have direct, high-speed access to an S3-compatible bucket (or local Garage / SeaweedFS / MinIO / Cloudflare R2).
2. **Quota Limits**: GitHub enforces a strict **10 GB per repository** cache limit. Once exceeded, older caches are evicted, causing unexpected slowdowns.
3. **Redundancy & Availability**: If GitHub's cache service experiences transient 503 errors or an outage, having S3 as an active peer ensures your builds never suffer cold starts.

With Dual Caching enabled, the **exact same cache keys** are populated in both systems, and jobs can seamlessly read from whichever source is optimal.

    CheckDual -- Yes --> Priority{restore-priority}

    Priority -- s3-first --> S3Try[1. Query S3 Storage]

    S3Try -- S3 Miss/Fail --> GHTry[2. Fallback to GitHub Cache]
    GHTry -- GH Hit --> RestoreGH[Restore from GitHub Cache\ncache-hit-source: github]
    GHTry -- GH Miss --> Miss[Cache Miss across both tiers\ncache-hit-source: none]

    GHTryFirst -- GH Hit --> RestoreGHFirst[Restore from GitHub Cache\ncache-hit-source: github]
    GHTryFirst -- GH Miss/Fail --> S3TrySecond[2. Fallback to S3 Storage]
    S3TrySecond -- S3 Hit --> RestoreS3Second[Restore from S3\ncache-hit-source: s3]
    S3TrySecond -- S3 Miss --> Miss
```

### Save Flow (Post-step)

When `dual-cache: true` is enabled, the post-run step evaluates both tiers according to `dual-cache-strategy`:

| Strategy                   | Behavior                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`backfill`** _(default)_ | If one tier hit but the other missed (e.g. GitHub Cache hit, S3 missed), post-save automatically **backfills** the missing tier so both systems stay synchronized. |
| **`independent`**          | Verifies existence in S3 and GitHub independently, uploading to any tier where the key is absent.                                                                  |
| **`skip-on-hit`**          | If an exact match hit occurred on _either_ tier during restore, saving is skipped on both.                                                                         |

## Real-World Use Cases & Examples

### Use Case 1: Lightweight Runners for Dependencies $\to$ Remote Cloud VM for Heavy Builds

A common architectural pattern is separating concerns across runner tiers to minimize cloud compute costs:

1. **Lightweight GitHub-hosted runner (`ubuntu-latest`)**: Runs quick tasks like `npm ci` to assemble `node_modules` or download package dependencies.
2. **Heavyweight Remote Cloud runner (`[self-hosted, aws-heavy]`)**: An EC2 or GCP machine with high CPU/GPU/RAM dedicated to compiling native artifacts, building Docker images, or executing end-to-end integration tests.

With **Dual Caching**:

- The GitHub-hosted runner uses `dual-cache: true` with `restore-priority: github-first` and `dual-cache-strategy: backfill`. It benefits from GitHub's internal runner cache, but **automatically synchronizes the populated `node_modules` directly into your AWS S3 or GCP bucket**.
- The remote cloud machine then restores `node_modules` directly from S3 at line-rate internal VPC speeds (`restore-priority: s3-first`) without network bottlenecking or GitHub cache quota contention.

          dual-cache-strategy: backfill  # Ensures S3 gets populated even if GitHub Cache hit
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-modules-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
          path: node_modules

### Use Case 2: Quota Spillover & High-Availability Redundancy

Avoid cold builds when GitHub's 10GB per-repo cache limit evicts keys, or during GitHub service disruptions:

```yaml
- name: Cache with S3 backup
  id: cache-step
  uses: xSAVIKx/cloud-cache-action@v1
  with:
    bucket: my-overflow-s3-bucket
    access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    secret-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    dual-cache: true
    restore-priority: github-first # Use GitHub cache while available
    dual-cache-strategy: backfill # Keep S3 continuously primed as cold-cache safety net
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-gradle-${{ hashFiles('**/*.gradle*') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-gradle-
    path: ~/.gradle/caches

- name: Inspect Cache Hit Source
  run: |
    echo "Cache Hit: ${{ steps.cache-step.outputs.cache-hit }}"
    echo "Serviced by: ${{ steps.cache-step.outputs.cache-hit-source }}" # 'github', 's3', or 'none'
```

### Use Case 3: Zero-Downtime Migration from GitHub Cache to Cloud Storage

If your team is migrating from `actions/cache` to Cloudflare R2 or AWS S3:

1. Enable `dual-cache: true` with `restore-priority: github-first`.
2. Existing builds will continue restoring instantly from GitHub Actions Cache.
3. In the background, `backfill` saves every cache bundle to your S3 bucket.
4. Once your S3 bucket is warmed up, switch `restore-priority: s3-first` or turn off dual-cache.
